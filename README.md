# Hello!
This was for my first site. I use it to experiment with different AI models and web tech. It changes often and I almost never save pics or anything. 
Below is a list of some of the stuff I've used or learned a bit to make it.
    - ChatGPT
    - Gemini
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Google Search (no shame in the game) :sweat_smile:
    - Visual Studio (We all know Notepad++ was better)
    - PC
    - Mac
    - Is this like a resume? :innocent:
    - Excel
    - Creative(drinking) Thinking
    - Some Docker
    - Paying every month for a domain
    - Hosting said domain using github and stuff
    - Having my own email domain (one letter before the @ is the ultimate sign of like knowing something)
    - Problem solving (probably my like specialty but humble brag??)
    - Learning
    - Has to be a resume...
