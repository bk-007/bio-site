# Hello! I'm Bryce.
<br>This was for my first site. I use it to experiment with different AI models and web tech. It changes often and I almost never save pics or anything so like RIP.
<br> ### Below is a list of some of the stuff I've used or learned a bit to make this masterpiece:
<br>- ChatGPT
<br>- Gemini
<br>- HTML
<br>- CSS
<br>- Google Search **(no shame in the game)** :sweat_smile:
<br>- Visual Studio **(We all know Notepad++ was better)**
<br>- PC
<br>- Mac
<br>- Is this like a resume? :innocent:
<br>- Excel
<br>- Creative Thinking
<br>- Some Docker
<br>- Paying every month for a domain
<br>- Hosting said domain using github and stuff
<br>- Having my own email domain **(one letter before the @ is the ultimate sign of like knowing something)**
<br>- Problem solving **(probably my like specialty but humble brag??)**
<br>- Learning
<br>- Has to be a resume... 
<br>
<br> ### What I'm Learning:
<br>- Life
<br>- Meditation
<br>- Mindfulness
<br>- Python
<br>- SQL
<br>- Excel **(like more though)**
<br>* I may be learning other stuff and this is all emcompassing. Messages like this are in job descriptions so this is like that...but like this.
